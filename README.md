This repository contains my solutions of the labs for [MIT 6.S191 Introduction to Deep Learning](http://introtodeeplearning.com/).

## Running the notebooks

The notebooks are made to run on Colab, be sure to use this button below (do not confuse it with the "Run MIT's original file in Google Colab")

You can also run them on your PC if you have the correct requirements, it's easier on Unix based systems. I have another repository where I adapt the Music generation lab to run on a windows machine, full tutorial included.
