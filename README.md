This repository contains my solutions of the labs for [MIT 6.S191 Introduction to Deep Learning](http://introtodeeplearning.com/).

## Running the notebooks

The notebooks are made to run on Colab, you cna also run them on your PC if you have the correct requirements, it's easier on Unix based systems. I have another repository where I adapt the Music generation lab to run on a windows machine, full tutorial included.
